rocGRAPH User Guide
********************************************************************

The rocGraph library includes an extensive set of graph algorithms (e.g. centrality, commmunity, components, link analysis, link prediction, etc)
that may be called directly via the C-API functions or may be called via Python (see the sections in this documentation on API functions). Furthermore, there
is also integration with the Python PyG and DGL libraries. The library is also designed to exploit multiple GPUs as well running on a single GPU via
MPI (Message Passing Interface).
